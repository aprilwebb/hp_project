# Harry Potter Trivia

# Overview
* This project is a site where Harry Potter fans can come to be sorted into their Hogwarts house, test their wizarding world knowledge, and learn fun facts they may not already know about our wizarding friends. Users will be able to create an account on the site and have their quiz scores and sorting results saved to their profiles. Users will be able to retake quizzes to try to beat their high scores and also take quizzes at different difficulty levels to increase their Hogwarts year level. 

# Features
